description: Resolve GitHub PR review comments end-to-end with evidence. Use when asked to process CR comments one by one, verify fixes, reply per thread, fix unresolved issues, produce minimal repair plans, explain why new CRs appear later, and decide whether each CR must be fixed before merge.

# gh-address-cr

Use this skill in strict incremental mode to minimize token usage while keeping review quality.

## Non-Negotiable Rule

`final_gate.sh` pass is mandatory before any completion statement.

- Never output "done", "all resolved", "completed", or equivalent unless:
  - `scripts/final_gate.sh <owner/repo> <pr_number>` has just passed, and
  - output includes `Verified: 0 Unresolved Threads found`.
- If gate fails, continue iteration; completion summary is forbidden.

## Core Protocol (Token-Optimized)

1. Run incremental triage first:
   - `scripts/run_once.sh [--audit-id <id>] <owner/repo> <pr_number>`
2. Process only unresolved + unhandled threads.
3. For each thread: `understand -> analyze/decide (Accept/Defer/Clarify) -> act (fix code OR write rationale) -> evidence reply -> resolve`. (Note: You MUST resolve the thread on GitHub after replying to pass the final gate).
4. Use minimal fixes and targeted tests first.
5. Before completion message, run hard gate (MANDATORY):
   - `scripts/final_gate.sh [--auto-clean|--no-auto-clean] [--audit-id <id>] <owner/repo> <pr_number>`
6. Only if gate passes, send merge-readiness summary.

## Decision Matrix (Analysis Phase)

Before modifying code, you MUST analyze the necessity of the CR suggestion:
- **Accept (Bug/Logic Error):** If the suggestion identifies a real issue or valid improvement with low architectural cost -> Proceed to fix code and generate evidence.
- **Defer (Nit/Preference with high cost):** If it's a stylistic preference requiring massive refactoring or architectural decay -> Do not change code. Use `scripts/generate_reply.sh --mode defer` to generate the trade-off explanation.
- **Clarify (Question/Misunderstanding):** If the reviewer misunderstood the logic or asks a question -> Do not change code. Use `scripts/generate_reply.sh --mode clarify` to generate the technical rationale.

## Hard Constraints (No Bypass)

- Never declare "done" without `final_gate.sh` pass.
- Never bypass state tracking with ad-hoc batch scripts.
- If unresolved exists, keep iterating; do not send completion summary.
- Each mid-run update must include either a pending list or explicit `Verified: 0 Unresolved Threads found`.

## Completion Output Contract

Any final completion message must include:

1. `final_gate` command used
2. gate result line: `Verified: 0 Unresolved Threads found`
3. unresolved count = 0 confirmation
4. audit summary path + sha256

## Mandatory Evidence & Rationale

- **If Accepted (Code Changed):** Provide Commit `<hash>`, Files `<file1,file2>`, and Validation `<test command>` + `<result>`. Never resolve an accepted thread without these 3 items.
- **If Deferred/Clarified (No Code Changed):** Provide a detailed, professional Rationale explaining why the code remains as is (e.g., architectural constraints, pointing out misunderstood logic).

## Must-Fix Rule

- Default must-fix: correctness bugs, data loss risks, platform/runtime breakage, packaging/install breakage, P1/P2 regressions.
- Can defer with rationale: style-only, naming preference, non-blocking wording improvements.

## Why CR Appears Later (Use This Exact Logic)

- GitHub review bots run asynchronously.
- New commits trigger re-analysis and can generate new comments.
- Old threads can become outdated; new ones may appear on different lines.

## Reusable Resources

- One-shot triage + state snapshot: `scripts/run_once.sh [--show-all] [--audit-id <id>] <owner/repo> <pr_number>`
- Final completion gate (mandatory): `scripts/final_gate.sh [--auto-clean|--no-auto-clean] [--audit-id <id>] <owner/repo> <pr_number>`
- Post reply: `scripts/post_reply.sh [--dry-run] [--repo <owner/repo> --pr <number>] [--audit-id <id>] <thread_id> <reply_file>`
- Resolve thread: `scripts/resolve_thread.sh [--dry-run] [--repo <owner/repo> --pr <number>] [--audit-id <id>] <thread_id>`
- Mark handled without resolving: `scripts/mark_handled.sh [--repo <owner/repo> --pr <number>] <thread_id>`
- Batch resolve from file: `scripts/batch_resolve.sh [--dry-run] [--yes] [--repo <owner/repo> --pr <number>] [--audit-id <id>] <thread_ids_file>`
- Generate reply draft: `scripts/generate_reply.sh [--mode fix|clarify|defer] [--severity P1|P2|P3] <output_md> [args...]`
- Clean local cache: `scripts/clean_state.sh [--repo <owner/repo> --pr <number> | --all] [--clean-tmp]`
- Audit report: `scripts/audit_report.sh <owner/repo> <pr_number>`
- Templates: `assets/reply-templates/`
- Reference checklist: `references/cr-triage-checklist.md`

## Fast Path

1. `scripts/run_once.sh --audit-id run-20260324 github/spec-kit 1906` to get unresolved threads excluding already-handled IDs.
2. **Analyze**: Decide whether to Accept, Defer, or Clarify.
3. Generate reply draft:
   - If Accepted (Code changed): `scripts/generate_reply.sh --mode fix --severity P2 /tmp/reply.md <commit> "<file1,file2>" "<test_cmd>" "<result>" "<why>"`
   - If Clarified (No code changed): `scripts/generate_reply.sh --mode clarify /tmp/reply.md "<detailed rationale why current logic is correct>"`
   - If Deferred (No code changed): `scripts/generate_reply.sh --mode defer /tmp/reply.md "<detailed rationale why this is deferred>"`
4. Preview:
   - `scripts/post_reply.sh --dry-run <thread_id> /tmp/reply.md`
5. Execute:
   - `scripts/post_reply.sh --repo github/spec-kit --pr 1906 --audit-id run-20260324 <thread_id> /tmp/reply.md`
   - `scripts/resolve_thread.sh --repo github/spec-kit --pr 1906 --audit-id run-20260324 <thread_id>`
6. Hard gate before completion:
   - `scripts/final_gate.sh --auto-clean --audit-id run-20260324 github/spec-kit 1906`

State cache lives in a user cache directory by default (override with `GH_ADDRESS_CR_STATE_DIR`) to avoid repeated labor across rounds. If the cache is purged, the workflow can be rebuilt from GitHub thread state; the main downside is potential repeated work.
