# gh-address-cr

Use this skill as the PR review orchestrator. It owns session state, intake routing, and the final gate.

## Usage

```text
/gh-address-cr review <owner/repo> <pr_number>
/gh-address-cr threads <owner/repo> <pr_number>
/gh-address-cr findings <owner/repo> <pr_number> --input <path>|-
/gh-address-cr adapter <owner/repo> <pr_number> <adapter_cmd...>
```

## Packaging Scope

This file is part of the packaged `gh-address-cr` skill.
All paths in this document are relative to the installed skill root.

- `scripts/...` means files inside this packaged skill
- `references/...` means skill-owned reference docs
- `agents/openai.yaml` is an assistant-specific hint file inside the skill

A surrounding source repository may also contain repo-level tests, CI, and release metadata, but those are outside the packaged skill payload.

## Agent Execution Ladder

Read this skill in this order when you are an AI agent:

1. Start from the public main entrypoint: `review <owner/repo> <pr_number>`.
2. If `review` returns `WAITING_FOR_EXTERNAL_REVIEW`, fill the handoff files in the PR workspace:
   - `producer-request.md`
   - `incoming-findings.json`
   - `incoming-findings.md`
3. Rerun the same `review` command. It will auto-consume findings JSON or fixed `finding` blocks and continue orchestration.
4. If `review` returns `BLOCKED`, inspect the loop request artifact, apply `fix`, `clarify`, or `defer`, then rerun the same `review` command.
5. Use `threads`, `findings`, `adapter`, and `review-to-findings` only as advanced/internal integration surfaces.

Fail-fast rules:

- `review` is the only public main entrypoint.
- `review` does not bind to any one review skill or tool name.
- If findings are absent, `review` returns `WAITING_FOR_EXTERNAL_REVIEW` and writes a standard producer handoff request instead of waiting on `stdin`.
- External review producer output must be findings JSON or fixed `finding` blocks.
- `review-to-findings` does not accept arbitrary Markdown. It only accepts the fixed `finding` block format.
- `review`, `threads`, and `adapter` require `gh` on `PATH` and fail immediately when it is missing.
- The high-level CLI commands are the only agent-safe public surface. Treat low-level scripts as internal implementation details.

Important:

- `review` is the default end-to-end orchestrator and the public main entrypoint.
- `review` manages session state, external review handoff, GitHub threads, and final-gate.
- `threads`, `findings`, `adapter`, and `review-to-findings` are advanced/internal entrypoints for explicit integrations.
- `review-to-findings` is only a converter. It is not a review engine and it is not a general Markdown parser.

Recommended high-level entrypoints:

- `review`
  - public main entrypoint
  - generates a standard producer handoff when findings are absent
  - handles both local findings and GitHub review threads in one run
- `threads`
  - advanced/internal: GitHub review threads only
- `findings`
  - advanced/internal: existing findings JSON only
  - handles local findings only; it does not process GitHub review threads
- `adapter`
  - advanced/internal: adapter-produced findings plus PR orchestration
- `review-to-findings`
  - advanced/internal: fixed-format finding blocks to findings JSON

Examples:

```text
$gh-address-cr review <PR_URL>
$gh-address-cr threads <PR_URL>
$gh-address-cr findings <PR_URL> --input findings.json
$gh-address-cr findings <PR_URL> --input - --sync
$gh-address-cr adapter <PR_URL> <adapter_cmd...>
$gh-address-cr review-to-findings <owner/repo> <pr_number> --input -
```

Minimal valid `review-to-findings` input:

````text
```finding
title: Missing null guard
path: src/example.py
line: 12
body: Potential null dereference.
```
````

This converter rejects plain narrative Markdown review output.

## Machine Summary Contract

High-level commands emit structured JSON by default. Agents should consume these fields, not parse human prose:

- `status`
- `repo`
- `pr_number`
- `item_id`
- `item_kind`
- `counts`
- `artifact_path`
- `reason_code`
- `waiting_on`
- `next_action`
- `exit_code`

`reason_code` is the stable machine reason. `waiting_on` is the stable wait-state category.
`counts.*` may be `null` in preflight wait/fail states before GitHub or session scans run.

## Advanced References

- Dispatch details: `references/mode-producer-matrix.md`
- Review triage checklist: `references/cr-triage-checklist.md`
- Low-level scripts are implementation details, not the public agent surface.

Examples that require advanced dispatch details live in the reference docs instead of the first-read contract.

## Entry Contract

Treat `SKILL.md` as the source of truth for using this skill.

- Start from the high-level dispatcher:
  - `python3 scripts/cli.py review <owner/repo> <pr_number>`
  - `python3 scripts/cli.py threads <owner/repo> <pr_number>`
  - `python3 scripts/cli.py findings <owner/repo> <pr_number> --input <path>|- [--sync]`
  - `python3 scripts/cli.py adapter <owner/repo> <pr_number> <adapter_cmd...>`
- Use `references/mode-producer-matrix.md` only for mode-specific dispatch details.
- Do not rely on `agents/openai.yaml` for unique behavior; it is only a thin assistant-specific hint layer.

## Capability Status

These high-level paths are fully operational now:

- `review`
- `threads`
- `findings`
- `adapter`

The internal iteration and dispatch layers are implementation details and are not part of the public entrypoint surface.

Advanced producer and dispatch details live in:

- `references/mode-producer-matrix.md`
- `references/cr-triage-checklist.md`

## Non-Negotiable Rule

`python3 scripts/cli.py final-gate` pass is mandatory before any completion statement.

- Never output "done", "all resolved", "completed", or equivalent unless:
  - `python3 scripts/cli.py final-gate <owner/repo> <pr_number>` has just passed, and
  - output includes `Verified: 0 Unresolved Threads found`, and
  - output includes `Verified: 0 Pending Reviews found`, and
  - session blocking item count is zero.
- Completion summaries must lead with a readable current-run handling summary from the same gate run, not just the final zero counts:
  - GitHub threads: total, new in this run, unresolved, handled in this run
  - local findings: total, new in this run, unresolved, handled in this run
  - prefer labeled phrasing such as `GitHub threads: total 2; new in this run 0; unresolved 0; handled in this run 0`
  - prefer the human-readable `Current Run Snapshot` block printed by `python3 scripts/cli.py final-gate ...`; use raw machine count lines only as fallback evidence
  - use `audit_summary.md` or the machine-readable count lines printed by `final-gate`
- If gate fails, continue iteration; completion summary is forbidden.

## Core Rules

1. Use the high-level task entrypoints first:
  - `python3 scripts/cli.py review <owner/repo> <pr_number>`
  - `python3 scripts/cli.py threads <owner/repo> <pr_number>`
  - `python3 scripts/cli.py findings <owner/repo> <pr_number> --input <path>|-`
  - `python3 scripts/cli.py adapter <owner/repo> <pr_number> <adapter_cmd...>`
2. Use the internal low-level dispatch only when the high-level entrypoints do not fit.
3. Process only unresolved GitHub threads and open local findings.
4. For GitHub review threads, reply and resolve are both mandatory.
5. Outdated / `STALE` GitHub threads are still unresolved until explicitly handled.
6. For local findings, terminal handling must include a note.
7. `producer=code-review` must emit findings JSON before session handling starts.
8. Never declare completion before `python3 scripts/cli.py final-gate` passes.

## Automatic Iteration

The default review entrypoint runs repeated intake, item selection, action execution, and gate evaluation internally until the PR session converges.

- The internal fixer handoff path uses the current AI agent by default.
- If a finding cannot be resolved automatically, the workflow records an internal fixer request artifact for the agent to handle.
- Advanced external fixer commands remain available for integrations that need an explicit command boundary.
- External fixer commands must read a JSON payload from stdin and return a JSON object containing:
  - `resolution`: `fix`, `clarify`, or `defer`
  - `note`
  - `reply_markdown` for GitHub thread items
  - optional `validation_commands`
- `code-review` and `json` producers are consumed once per review run.
- `adapter` producer is re-run on each iteration.
- The workflow exits as:
  - `PASSED` when gate succeeds
  - `NEEDS_HUMAN` when retry thresholds are exceeded
  - `BLOCKED` when a non-recoverable orchestration step fails

## Producer Contract

`gh-address-cr` is the orchestrator. Producers are replaceable.

- `code-review` is a producer, not the session owner.
- `code-review` here means "review-style findings producer", not one mandatory skill name.
- `code-review` now uses the built-in `code-review-adapter` backend for structured intake.
- If the upstream review output is fixed-format `finding` blocks, normalize it with `review-to-findings` before ingestion.
- `review-to-findings` does not accept arbitrary Markdown prose.
- `gh-address-cr` only assumes the normalized finding contract:
  - `title`
  - `body`
  - `path`
  - `line`
- Accepted findings input shapes:
  - JSON array of finding objects
  - JSON object with `findings`, `issues`, or `results`
  - NDJSON, one finding object per line
- Accepted field aliases:
  - `path` or `file` or `filename`
  - `line` or `start_line` or `position`
  - `title` or `rule` or `check`
  - `body` or `message` or `description`
- Input path rule:
  - use `--input <path>` only when a producer already emitted a real JSON file
  - otherwise prefer `--input -` and pipe findings through `stdin`
  - do not create ad-hoc temporary findings files in the project workspace just to drive the workflow
- Refresh rule:
  - use `--sync` when re-ingesting the same source and you want missing local findings to auto-close
- Supported dispatch paths live in:
  - `references/mode-producer-matrix.md`


## Discovery Rules

Use this skill when the task involves one or more of these needs:

- handle GitHub PR review threads with explicit reply and resolve steps
- ingest local review findings into a PR-scoped session
- run a final gate before declaring review completion
- keep remote threads and local findings under one auditable PR session

Do not use this skill as the review engine itself.

- It manages intake, state, processing discipline, and gating.
- It does not own the reasoning logic of external review producers.

## Decision Matrix

- **Accept**: real bug or low-cost valid improvement; fix and provide evidence.
- **Clarify**: reviewer misunderstood the code; explain without changing code.
- **Defer**: non-blocking or high-cost preference; explain the tradeoff.
- **Reject**: suggestion is technically incorrect, conflicts with the current contract, or would break an intentional compatibility guarantee.

## Fix Selection Rules

Before changing code, classify each item in this order:

1. **Validity**
   - `confirmed`: reproducible in current HEAD or directly supported by code/tests
   - `unclear`: not yet verified; do not implement blindly
   - `rejected`: technically incorrect or based on missing context
2. **Impact**
   - Does it affect correctness, session/gate consistency, runtime safety, compatibility, packaging, or CI?
3. **Scope Fit**
   - Is the fix local to the current PR, or does it expand into a new design decision or larger refactor?
4. **Decision**
   - `fix`, `clarify`, `defer`, or `reject`

Use these defaults:

- Default to `fix` for correctness bugs, state mismatches, concurrency hazards, compatibility regressions, install/runtime breakage, and P1/P2 issues that can be verified.
- Default to `clarify` when behavior is intentional and the reviewer lacks context.
- Default to `defer` when the issue is real but out of scope for the current PR or would force broader redesign.
- Default to `reject` when the suggestion is technically unsound or would violate an explicit workflow contract.

Do not change code until the item has been validated and classified.

## Scope Guardrails

Do not "fix" items just to make the thread disappear.

- Do not expand the PR with unrelated refactors.
- Do not change public behavior for style-only comments.
- Do not weaken compatibility defaults unless the review identifies a real regression.
- Do not let a reviewer preference override an existing, tested contract without explicit product intent.

If a review item is real but not appropriate for the current PR, reply with `defer` and a concrete rationale instead of stretching scope.

## Needs-Human Escalation

Prefer `NEEDS_HUMAN` over speculative fixes when:

- the claim cannot be verified from the codebase or tests
- two valid concerns conflict and require a product decision
- the fix would create a new interface or contract
- the same item keeps reopening after multiple technically sound attempts
- the suggestion conflicts with an intentional compatibility or workflow rule and the tradeoff is not obvious

`gh-address-cr` should stop iteration and escalate rather than forcing an implementation under uncertainty.

## Required Evidence

- Accepted GitHub thread:
  - commit
  - touched files
  - validation command and result
- Clarified or deferred item:
  - rationale
- Local finding terminal state:
  - note

## Completion Contract

Final output must include:

1. `final_gate` command used
2. readable current-run handling summary from the same gate run:
   - GitHub threads total, new in this run, unresolved, handled in this run
   - local findings total, new in this run, unresolved, handled in this run
   - prefer labeled phrasing such as `GitHub threads: total 2; new in this run 0; unresolved 0; handled in this run 0`
3. `Verified: 0 Unresolved Threads found`
4. `Verified: 0 Pending Reviews found`
5. unresolved GitHub threads = 0
6. session blocking items = 0
7. audit summary path + sha256

For run-scoped diagnostics, use:

- `python3 scripts/audit_report.py --run-id <run_id> <owner/repo> <pr_number>`
- successful `python3 scripts/cli.py final-gate --auto-clean ...` runs archive the PR workspace before deletion under `archive/<owner>__<repo>/pr-<pr>/<run_id>/`

## Must-Fix Rule

- Default must-fix: correctness bugs, data loss risks, platform/runtime breakage, packaging/install breakage, P1/P2 regressions.
- Can defer with rationale: style-only, naming preference, non-blocking wording improvements.
- For this repo, fix priority is:
  - session / gate / iteration semantic mismatches
  - GitHub reply / resolve / pending-review visibility issues
  - CLI and shell-wrapper compatibility regressions
  - workspace/cache side effects
  - test and CI breakage caused by real implementation changes
  - documentation/runtime mismatches that mislead actual usage

## Why CR Appears Later (Use This Exact Logic)

- GitHub review bots run asynchronously.
- New commits trigger re-analysis and can generate new comments.
- Old threads can become outdated; new ones may appear on different lines.
